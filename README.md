# Object detection and pose estimation toolbox

This repository provides tools to evaluate performance of an object detection and pose estimation method. It is based on the methodology introduced in the article [1] that is suited for any rigid object and can deal with scenes of many object instances, potentially occluded.

This toolbox has been primarily designed for use with the [Siléane Dataset](https://rbregier.github.io/dataset2017) but is generic and may be used with other datasets as well, provided with adapted ground truth annotations, and description of the object's geometry and symmetries (poseutils.json file).

## Current features
- evaluation_tools: computation of precision/recall curves with various evaluation goals, and various metrics (F1 score, Average Precision, Mean Average Precision, etc). 
- visualization: conversion of data from the Siléane Dataset into colored pointcloud.  
See the *examples* folder for typical use.

## Results format
Results to evaluate are expected to be stored in JSON format for each scene such as illustrated in *examples/experiences*, and to consist in a list of pose hypotheses described by a rigid transformation ("R", "t") and a an arbitrary confidence score "score" used to rank them (the higher the score, the higher the confidence in the hypothese).
Other format may be used by providing a proper overloading the *_load_results_list* and *_results_file_extension* variables contained in *evaluation_tools.py*.

## Dependencies
Python 3+, Matplotlib, Numpy.
